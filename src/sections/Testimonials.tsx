                It was the best choice we could have made. It was an incredible
                and unforgettable experience. Said is very professional and
                exceedingly knowledgeable about Morocco – its history,
                geography, politics, people – and eager to share this knowledge
                if you show an interest. It was a pleasure spending time with
                him and learning about his wonderful country. I would highly
                recommend Open Doors Morocco to everyone wishing a true Moroccan
                experience. From the 4×4 (which had wifi!) to the desert camp
                accommodations, everything was perfect.

              <p>
                I feel like we saw the “real Morocco” not just the touristy
                sites but some hidden gems also. From the time Habib met us at
                the airport, I felt like we were in good hands.

                I have traveled extensively around the world and I can not say
                enough about the fabulous tour that we, (I am one of four
                California women,) took with Open Doors Morocco.

                It was the best choice we could have made—an unforgettable

                I cannot say enough about how Said [our guide] made our visit to
                Morocco so special His style in how he presented every new venue
                to us was a much anticipated surprise around every corner. The
                trip could not have been better and I must say that he made it
                one of the best I have ever experienced.
